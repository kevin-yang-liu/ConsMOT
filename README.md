## Research Paper: Machine Learning in Construction Site Safety
Co-authored a research paper (currently under review) on a machine learning construction site surveillance system developed with a research team at Tianjin University of Science and Technology (TUST), called ConsMOT: a birds-eye-view system built on a FairMOT-based tracking pipeline using CenterNet detection, ReID embeddings, PyTorch, and CUDA. ConsMOT tracks and alerts workers if they are within a dangerous distance from crane-hoisted goods.
