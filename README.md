## Research Paper: Machine Learning in Construction Site Safety
Co-authored a research paper (currently under review) on a machine learning construction site surveillance system developed by my team at the Tianjin University of Science and Technology (TUST), called ConsMOT: A birds-eye-view system that uses YOLOv5 model trained on 7000+ images to identify and alert workers when it predicts crane-hoisted goods are seconds from collide with one of them, avoiding potential deadly injuries.
